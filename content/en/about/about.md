## Origin of the Website Name

"Ming Zefei (明泽飞)" was my nickname during middle school, derived from "Yueyang Tower Notes": "The spring is mild and the scenery is bright, the waves are calm without disturbance, the light from above and below, all is one vast expanse of blue."  
Sometimes I also rewrite it as "Ming Zefei (明则非)", expressing another layer of meaning (easier to understand in the Chinese cultural context).

## Interests

- Outdoor hiking, I've left my footprints on almost all the mountains around Beijing;
- Niche hobbies like amateur radio, Jin Guang puppetry, and drift boards;
- In daily life, I pay attention to folk culture and literary notes.

## What Have I Tinkered With?

- WSL2(Ubuntu): During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to Linux through supercomputing platforms, which opened up my new programming world. Now I've found a balance between Windows and Linux on WSL2, along with some bugs of course;
- Vim and NeoVim: Once strived to practice "Vim everything" to improve efficiency;
- LaTeX: Used for serious writing, developed templates and related script tools;
- Research software: Familiar with VASP, Comsol, etc., and have done secondary development.
