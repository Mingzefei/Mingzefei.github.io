## About Me

I am Guangbin Hua (华广斌), graduated from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Beihang University in 2022, where I received a Bachelor of Engineering degree under the guidance of Professor Zhang Qianfan (张千帆), with a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. In 2025, I graduated from the School of Reliability and Systems Engineering at Beihang University under the mentorship of Prof. Zili Wang (王自力), Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, earning a Master of Engineering degree with interdisciplinary advantages in materials, control, and reliability.  
My research interests primarily focus on simulation modeling and performance optimization, especially reliability-related modeling and optimization; research objects include battery storage and microelectronic interconnections.

Currently, I am conducting research at home, refining the results of my master's studies, and actively applying for doctoral programs. If you have doctoral recruitment plans or collaboration opportunities, I sincerely look forward to connecting with you!

## Origin of the Website Name

"Ming Zefei (明泽飞)" was my nickname during middle school, derived from "Yueyang Tower Notes": "The spring is mild and the scenery is bright, the waves are calm without disturbance, the light from above and below, all is one vast expanse of blue."  
Sometimes I also rewrite it as "Ming Zefei (明则非)", expressing another layer of meaning (easier to understand in the Chinese cultural context).

## Interests

- Outdoor hiking, I've left my footprints on almost all the mountains around Beijing;
- Niche hobbies like amateur radio, Jin Guang puppetry, and drift boards;
- In daily life, I pay attention to folk culture and literary notes.

## What Have I Tinkered With?

- WSL2(Ubuntu): During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to Linux through supercomputing platforms, which opened up my new programming world. Now I've found a balance between Windows and Linux on WSL2, along with some bugs of course;
- Vim and NeoVim: Once strived to practice "Vim everything" to improve efficiency;
- LaTeX: Used for serious writing, developed templates and related script tools;
- Research software: Familiar with VASP, Comsol, etc., and have done secondary development.
